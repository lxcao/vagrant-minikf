Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable, so kubectl detects and uses this file:

    macOS / Linux: Open a terminal, then run:
    export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/minikf-kubeconfig
    Windows: Open a Command Prompt, then run:
    SET KUBECONFIG=%HOMEPATH%/minikf-kubeconfig

You should now be able to list running Kubeflow pods in your MiniKF:
kubectl -n kubeflow get pods
